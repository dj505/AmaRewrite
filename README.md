# Notes:

GriffinG1: You've managed to waste hours of my life and cause much more additional stress on top of me being at a point where I was already stressed enough to begin with. Submitting a DMCA takedown request against my own personal, unrelated work because you're salty about being banned from SwitchHaxing (for valid reasons may I add) isn't cool. Hope you're happy with yourself, and I hope you realize that this is the kind of thing that gives people reason to dislike you as much as they do. Thank you for your time.
